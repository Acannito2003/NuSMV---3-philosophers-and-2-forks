# NuSMV---3-philosophers-and-2-forks
A NuSMV model of the Dining Philosophers problem with 3 philosophers and only 2 forks. A turn-based scheduler controls state transitions to ensure mutual exclusion. Forks are used as a single shared resource, enabling analysis of safety, liveness, and potential deadlock scenarios.
